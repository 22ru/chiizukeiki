**********************

The program must be run as root or you won't be able to access
/dev/uinput

Your joycon will need to be connected before running this program.

http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html

I'm adding a udev rule for left joycons instead of searching for it.
Read the above link for some clarification on the selection rules
if you are having issues.

Create file "99-joycon.rules" in /etc/dev/rules.d/ with this line:

ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="Joy-Con (L)", SYMLINK+="joycon-l"

*****************

Run:
evtest /dev/joycon-l 
to view your joycon inputs

You can also view the uinput virtual device using
evtest
and choosing the number corresponding to "Cheesecake"

*****************

Notes on key map config file:

each line has 6 numbers
event_type event_code event_value outputkey_0 outputkey_1 outputkey_2 

The first three will be used to match the key used.
Type 1 is a button/key press.
Choosing 1 for the event value for keypress is pressed,
0 is released, 2 is held.

Type 3 is an analog stick movement. 0 is released,
1 and -1 are directions.

I am choosing to ignore all holds, releases, syncs, and misc presses.

The final 3 numbers are the keys which should be activated.

Use this file to get the codes for the key you want to send.
Use 0 for empty spaces. There MUST be 3 numbers here.

You can have up to 20 lines, but the left joycon only has 14 possible 
inputs.
