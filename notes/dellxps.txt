Can change the scale factor for the program
but half the time, it refuses to display
env QT_SCALE_FACTOR=.5 krita

Instead, I used
xrandr --output DP-2 --scale 2x2
(DP-2 is the cintiq)

Still might want to consider adding ctrl and alt buttons to udev if slowdown occurs.
It'll free 4 of the 26 rules. Removing the unused SR button in the map would 
free 2 more if I can't find a use for them

Issue:
stylus cannot click buttons in the krita UI
-tried again and it works? Keep an eye on it
