The Struggle

Getting the device info:

Before connecting your joycon over bluetooth, I recommend going to your switch settings and
disconnecting all controllers while the joycon you want to use is physically disconnected from the switch.
This will save you a lot of pain attempting to connect.

run:
sudo evtest
There are 2 events for the joycon. Don't choose the one ending in IMU.

Extra difficulty:

Run: 
udevadm monitor --property
and then connect to the joycon to get the device path

Then,
udevadm info --attribute-walk --path=/devices/[your path here]

If in nowhere in the list is the vendor and product code, you are hecked.

The vendor is 0x57e and product is 0x2006.

**************************

Creating the rule:

Cheesecake is looking for the symlink "joycon-l", so whatever rule you come up with has to add this.

Create file "99-joycon.rules" in /etc/udev/rules.d/ with this line:

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{id/vendor}=="057e", ATTRS{id/product}=="2006", ATTRS{properties}!="40", SYMLINK+="joycon-l"

excluding properties of 40 because this is the difference between the IMU and normal event

Restart or run:
sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger

**************************

Run:
evtest /dev/joycon-l 
to view your joycon inputs


You can also view the uinput virtual device using evtest
and choosing the event number corresponding to "Cheesecake"

**************************

Still doesn't work? Make sure your udev rule is being read:
sudo udevadm test /devices/[your path here]
I spent hours once troubleshooting to find I had written the file in the wrong path.

Still no? Pray to god you have a friend who can help. I cannot help you.
Reinstall blueman, update your kernel, disconnect and reconnect your joycon, cry. Good luck.

To check if hid-nintendo (the driver) is installed:
sudo modinfo hid-nintendo
